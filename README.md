###                                    Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to build a data-driven approach for analyzing and predicting insurance risks and profit margins using a dataset containing customer, vehicle, and insurance-related information. The project involves several key tasks:

Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature engineering to enhance the predictive power of the models.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze the distributions of key variables, detect patterns, and explore relationships between different features (e.g., TotalPremium, TotalClaims, Zip Codes, Provinces, Gender).
A/B Hypothesis Testing:

Test various hypotheses such as risk differences across provinces, zip codes, and gender using statistical tests like t-tests and chi-squared tests.
Machine Learning Modeling:

Implement predictive models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forests, XGBoost) to predict TotalPremium and TotalClaims, and evaluate model performance using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R-squared.
Feature Importance and Interpretability:

Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret model predictions and analyze which features have the most influence on outcomes such as insurance risk and profit margin.
The ultimate goal is to identify key drivers of insurance risk and profit, allowing insurers to:

Better assess insurance premiums.
Understand which factors (e.g., vehicle type, coverage type, geography) influence risk and profit.
Make informed business decisions based on data insights from machine learning models.


## Data Description

The dataset contains insurance data with the following key columns:
- `TotalPremium`: The total premium charged to customers.
- `TotalClaims`: The total claims made by customers.
- `Province`, `PostalCode`, `Gender`: Categorical features used in the hypothesis testing and modeling.
- Other features related to the vehicle, coverage type, and customer attributes.
